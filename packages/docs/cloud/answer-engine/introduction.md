# The Orama Answer Engine

Orama is an answer engine. When you integrate your data, it will create an RAG pipeline to let you ask questions about your data and get precise, reliable answers back.

To get started with the Orama answer engine, simply [create a new index](/cloud/working-with-indexes/create-a-new-index) and enable [automatic embedding generation](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation).

At the time of writing, you will also need to [set up an OpenAI API key](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation#using-openai) to make the Answer engine work. We will release more integrations with more LLMs soon.

This is all youâ€™ll need to trigger the Orama RAG pipeline.
